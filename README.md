## Installation

# Setting Up
* First, you'll need to ensure you have [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) installed on your computer. This workshop requires that you have version `1.4` installed, which requires Erlang `v18`.

* Next, clone this project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mike-works/elixir-fundamentals.git myelixir
```
* Then, go into the project and install dependencies
```sh
cd myelixir
mix deps.get
```

## Development Environment

Setup a development environment that includes Elixir syntax hilighting. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following plugins
* [vscode-elixir](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmcloug.vscode-elixir) - for syntax hilighting and intellisense (autocomplete) of Elixir and Erlang core libraries.
* [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) - for quick execution of code snippets
* [Dark+ Elixir (color theme)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kkalita.dark-plus-elixir) - highlights some important parts of the language syntax more prominently than many default themes
