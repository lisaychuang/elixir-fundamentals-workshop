# [Mike North's Elixir Fundamentals Course](https://github.com/mike-works/elixir-fundamentals)

This course is created by [Mike North](https://github.com/mike-north), see below notes for licensing information. 

# Lisa's notes

I'll be adding notes from training on 2018/4/19 here!

### Anonymous Function
Anonymous functions have implicit returns (similar to Ruby), where the last statement in the function is the return value

Example:
`fn x -> x * x end`

### Print to console debugging
h IO.puts - help docs
IO.inspect - logging out
elixir - compiles files and execute
IEx - interactive Elixir 
iex.pry - breakpoints
