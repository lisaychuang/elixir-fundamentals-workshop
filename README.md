# Elixir Fundamentals Workshop

Attending Rails to Elixir & Phoenix workshop with Michael North @mike-north in Berlin, Germany 2017/4/24 - 2017/4/26.

Workshop details: https://elixir-phoenix-workshop.simplabs.com/

## Phoenix and Elixir

The Phoenix Framework allows developers to build robust, performant and scalable web applications faster than ever. By combining Elixir's modern language syntax and tried-and tested foundation, with many of the productivity benefits that made Ruby on Rails astonishingly popular, this new web framework promises to be great (dare I say, ideal?) option for a variety of projects.
